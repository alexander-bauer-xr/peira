# Peira Project

The Peira Project is an art and cultural initiative that fosters collaboration and critical practice. It offers training and workshops for artists, focusing on concept development, cultural reflection, and funding strategies. The project also produces podcasts and media works exploring themes like migrant resistance and cultural identity.

The website, built with Laravel, serves as a digital home for these initiatives â€” presenting content such as podcast episodes, documentation projects, event series, and artistic statements. It functions as a hybrid between an archive and a living program, with a clean and multilingual frontend powered by a headless Drupal CMS.
